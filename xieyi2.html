Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 27, 2026

Thank you for using our game (the “Application”). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting user information. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the Application.

1. Information Collection

The Application is an offline single-player game.

We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information, including but not limited to:

Name

Phone number

Address

Email address

Location data

Contacts

The Application does not require user registration and can function without an internet connection.

2. Automatically Generated Technical Information

The Application itself does not actively collect personal information.

During normal operation, the Android operating system may automatically generate limited technical data such as crash logs or performance diagnostics. These data remain on the user’s device or are handled by the operating system, and we do not access, collect, or store such information.

3. Third-Party Services

The Application currently does not use third-party advertising, analytics, or login services.

If such services are added in future versions, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.

4. Children’s Privacy

The Application is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If such information is discovered, it will be deleted promptly.

5. Data Security

Since we do not collect personal data, no user data is stored or shared.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page.
